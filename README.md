# Swarm-sec: A native cluster security assessment tool

---

Inspired by docker bench, the goal of swarm-bench is to identify security issues in a docker native cluster system, draft test suites and cases for the cluster setting (similar to the CIS Docker Benchmark document), and develop a tool to evaluate the security level of a given cluster.
